	  <h1>Objectives</h1>
	  <p>
		  
		  
		  
Information systems are becoming more and more intertwined with systems and approaches developed with the purpose of keeping us healthy and increasing our general wellbeing. In the two previous workshops on Health Recommender Systems (HRS), we elaborated a great variety of fields in which recommender systems can improve our awareness, understanding and behavior regarding our own, and the general public's health. At the same time, these application areas bring new challenges into the recommender community. Recommendations that influence the health status of a patient need to be liable, today, they often involve a human in the loop to make sure the recommendations are sound. To make the recommender liable, complex domain-specific user models need to be created, which creates privacy issues. While trust in a recommendation needs to be explicitly earned by e.g. transparency, explanations and empowerment, other systems might want to persuade users into beneficial actions that would not be willingly chosen otherwise. The variety of those challenges also results from the number and diversity of stakeholders involved in health systems. Taking the patient's perspective, simple interaction and safety against harmful recommendations might be the prioritized concern. For clinicians and experts, on the other hand, what matters is precise and accurate content. Finally, health care providers, insurance providers, and clinics are interested in other aspects, e.g. success rates, study results, and financial benefits of the new systems. This workshop goes deeper into the discussions started at the two prior workshops and works towards further development of the research topics in Health Recommender Systems.

<p>Our aim is to enhance the results of the first two workshops in the following areas:
<ul>
<li>Elaborate discussion topics of the previous workshops on health promotion, health care as well as methods
<li>Strengthen the community of researchers working on Health in RecSys
<li>Attract representatives from e.g. health, psychology, medicine, nutrition, fitness
<li>Find cross-domain collaboration projects and funding targets
<li>Exchange and share infrastructure (datasets and tools)
</ul>
</p>
<p>We invite submissions that may include the following topics, but are not limited to:
<ul>
<li>Algorithms and Recommendation Strategies
<li>Domain Knowledge Representation
<li>Regulations and Standards
<li>Medical Evaluation Techniques
<li>User Profiling
<li>Pervasive Systems
<li>Personalization
<li>Behavioral Interventions
<li>Persuasion/Nudging/Behavioral Change
<li>Gamification and Serious Games
<li>Adherence
<li>Empowerment
<li>Trust
<li>Explanations
<li>Patient Needs/ Satisfaction
<li>User Interaction Design
<li>Human/ Expert-in-the-Loop
<li>Privacy
<li>Ethics
</ul></p>
<p>The goal of this workshop is to share and discuss research and projects that reach beyond classic recommender techniques and discuss health domain related challenges of recommender systems.</p>

<a id="submission"></a> 
	  <h1>Submission</h1>
<p>We solicit short research papers (Up to 6 pages) and short position papers (2 pages), both in the ACM conference paper style. Participants can decide between a research focused submission and a project focused submission. A selection of best papers will be presented in a flash talk. Further papers will be presented in the form of a poster. Papers should be submitted in EasyChair to the submission page.</p>
<p>Submission category research: innovative research ideas, preliminary results or system prototypes</p>
<p>Submission category project: funded research projects, industry and research collaborations or health-care and research collaborations</p>
<p>Submission guidelines: All submitted papers must
<ul>
<li>be written in English;
<li>contain author names, affiliations, and email addresses;
<li>be formatted according to the <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template">ACM SIG Proceedings Template</a> with a font size no smaller than 9pt;
<li>be in PDF (make sure that the PDF can be viewed on any platform), and formatted for US Letter size;
</ul>
</p>
<p>Link or demo in attachment are preferred in both cases. All papers will be peer-reviewed, must not be under review in any other conference, workshop or journal (at the time of submission), and must contain novel contributions. Accepted papers will be published according to the ACM RECSYS 2018 WS publication rules. The Workshop proceedings will be submitted to CEUR-WS.</p>
<p>Please use the workshop's <a href=" https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=healthrecsys18">EasyChair submission page</a> for submitting your paper.</p>
<p><b>A few remarks:</b>
<ol>
<li>The title of the paper, authors, and the author order cannot be changed after the acceptance
<li>Major changes to the text of the reviewed and accepted papers are not permitted after the review
<li>At least one of the authors should participate in the workshop, register in the RecSys conference, and personally present the paper in the workshop.
</ol>

	<h3 id="keynote">Keynote: Dr. Mohammad M. Ghassemi</h3>
<p><b>Title: The Challenges and Opportunities for Healthcare Recommendation Systems in a Rapidly Evolving Health Data Ecosystem.</b></p>
<p>Abstract: Existing Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems are rich, and often highly heterogeneous, sources of data. In the last ten years, there has been ample interest in how the growing volume of EHR data may be used to better monitor and support decisions at the bedside, with several of the largest industrial players now entering the arena (Google, Apple Microsoft and Amazon). But EHR systems are designed to mitigate clinical liability and facilitate billing, not to support algorithm development. As the most well-resourced data companies continue their push into healthcare domain, EMR systems will inevitably change to accommodate algorithm designers. In this talk, we will present several case studies that highlight the challenges and opportunities that are available in this rapidly evolving data ecosystem, and the import role that academic researchers can play in forging the future of recommendation systems in health.
</p>
<p>Biography: Dr. Mohammad M. Ghassemi is the co-founder and President of the Ghamut Corporation (winner of the 2017 MassChallenge), where he leads the development of tools, datasets, and AI methods for a variety of health and behavioral science problems. He holds a Ph.D from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in computer science, and will be joining the faculty of Computer Science and Engineering as an Assistant Professor in the Fall of 2019 at Michigan State University (MSU). As a student, Mohammad was the recipient of several academic distinctions including the Gates-Cambridge, and Goldwater Fellowships. He is currently regarded for his work in creating several of the world's largest open access intensive care databases, a wearable A.I. for social coaching, and a platform that intelligently connects university students to improve campus culture. He holds multiple US patents, has published a book on the secondary use of health data (with over 100,000 downloads), and has over 20 peer-reviewed publications in venues including: the Proceedings of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence, Nature Scientific Data and Science Translational Medicine. He regularly works with industry (Allstate, Estee Lauder, Thomson Reuters, and Samsung) to guide innovation strategy, and built data-powered technologies. </p>
